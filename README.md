# DSA_Min_Spanning_Tree

This project is written in C++ and was completed for a Data Structures & Algorithms course whilst at university.

I have uploaded this project here so that I may look back in a few years and see my code when I first learnt C++.

## Program Requirements

Primâ€™s algorithm (covered in class) to calculate the minimum spanning tree is of the order of O(n3). The algorithm below is of the order of of O(n2). Add a function to implement this algorithm to the class msTreeType and write a program to test this version of prims algorithm. The test program should display the graph and the minimum spanning tree that has been found for that graph in the form of matrices.

## Notes

The Minimal Spanning Tree allows users to generate a random weighted graph with a max size of 150.

The user's can specify the source vertex to test the Prims 1 & Prims 2 functions, they can return to the main program by pressing 'f' or 'F' and hitting enter.

Users can then quit the program via pressing 'q' or 'Q'
